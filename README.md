## Project Overview

The project involves using neural network techniques to break Hcaptcha. The dataset for this project was collected from various websites that use Hcaptcha. The data was preprocessed and cleaned before being used for training and testing the neural network models.

The project includes the following steps:

1.Data Collection: Collecting data from websites that use Hcaptcha.

2.Preprocessing: Preprocessing and cleaning the collected data to make it ready for training and testing the models.

3.Model Selection: Selecting the appropriate neural network model for solving the Hcaptcha problem.

4.Model Training: Training the selected neural network model on the preprocessed data.

5.Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained neural network model on a test dataset.


## Model Evaluation

The trained model was evaluated on a test dataset consisting of Hcaptcha images. The model is capable of solving the Hcaptcha problem with high accuracy.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of using neural network techniques for solving the Hcaptcha problem. The trained model achieved high accuracy on the test dataset, which shows that it can be deployed for solving Hcaptcha in real-time.
